# General
Just general stuffs that don't deserve their own repository,
or are me tinkering with ideas before I give them enough value for an entire repo!

- AdaUtils.d: just some random useful D utilities. 
- ~~pVerify.d: An attempt at a proof verifier based off a personal mathematics project (more like a pipe dream)~~ (separate repository!)
